1. Project Structure & Documentation
Add a README.md

Overview of purpose ➔ “DailyLoginAutomator”

Installation steps (Python version, pip install -r requirements.txt)

Usage examples (python run.py --create-profile …, python run.py --run-profile …, scheduling)

Include a LICENSE file to clarify usage rights.

Create a docs/ folder (or GitHub Pages) with:

Architecture diagram (modules and data flow)

Configuration reference (fields in default_settings.json)

Profile JSON schema

Move CLI logic to a modern framework (e.g. Typer) for richer help, subcommands, and argument validation.

2. Configuration & Settings
Support multiple formats (allow YAML or .env overrides in addition to JSON).

Validate default_settings.json on load (schema validation with jsonschema).

Allow per-profile overrides (e.g. custom launch_delay, action sequence) stored alongside each profile.

3. AutomationEngine Enhancements
Bring game window to front using platform APIs (e.g. pywinauto on Windows) rather than naïve center-click.

Parameterized action sequences:

Read a list of steps from the profile (e.g. click at coords, OCR check, keystrokes) instead of hard-coded “press enter.”

Dynamic delay tuning: expose a calibration mode to measure actual load time before running.

Error recovery: if the reward isn’t detected (OCR mismatch), retry a configurable number of times and log failures.

4. Scheduler & Execution
Integrate with OS scheduler (Windows Task Scheduler / cron) so the script can be installed as a background job.

Expose a “daemon” or “service” mode in the CLI that runs in the background and watches for schedule triggers.

Add a --schedule flag to run.py so you can do:

bash
Copy
Edit
python run.py --schedule MyGame 09:00
instead of editing Python files.

5. Logging & Observability
Use structured logging (e.g. JSON logs) and allow adjustable log levels via CLI (--verbose, --debug).

Log rotation: integrate with [logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler] to prevent unbounded log growth.

Add telemetry hooks (opt-in) to track success/failure counts over time.

6. Testing & Quality
Introduce a tests/ directory with unit tests using pytest:

Test SettingsManager loading/validation.

Mock subprocess.Popen to verify AutomationEngine.run() launches the correct EXE.

ProfileManager: ensure create_profile and load_profile round-trip.

Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions workflow to run linting (flake8/mypy), tests, and packaging checks on each PR.

Code formatting

Enforce PEP8 with black and static typing with mypy.

7. Packaging & Distribution
Add pyproject.toml (or setup.py) to make the project installable via pip install ..

Publish to PyPI (optionally) so users can pip install DailyLoginAutomator.

Versioning

Bump a __version__ in automator/__init__.py and tag releases in Git.

8. Profiles & Backup Management
JSON schema for profiles and settings so users get validation errors up front.

Profile editor CLI or minimal TUI to walk users through path, delay, and action configuration.

BackupManager

Rotate backups (keep last N only).

Compress older backups.

Implementing these will make the project more robust, user-friendly, and maintainable.
